## Notes

- All queries are generated based on the **datasense** database schema
- The LLM understands business context (ordersâ†’invoices, stock management, returns)
- Financial calculations follow business rules (net revenue, outstanding payments)
- Queries respect business flows (status progressions, immutability)
- Only SELECT queries are executed (read-only for safety)
- All queries rely on the llama3:8b model with business context training
